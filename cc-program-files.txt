Callicore todo:

1. Generic Help Window (a la mozembed/gtkhtml only with textbuffer - reads docbook? html?)
2. Generic About (similiar to splash)
3. Generic Treeview (with working dnd - write the overrides)
4. Multitoolbar/toolbar detach support - hidden expose for images?
5. Generic preferences window (I like firefoxes, although options for pane location will probably be needed)

CC_Messages: add expander with treeview of trace information for errors

Treeview improvements - 
DND - easy implementing dnd even when sorted, including highlight drop location and creating row image and reordering
Editing - easy edit in place
columns - easy reordering and choose columns to view
right click - with edit, delete options

basic printing with lpr or just implement 2.10?
